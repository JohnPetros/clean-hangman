## 🖥️ About the project

**Hangman** is a classic game in which the player guesses a word of a certain category within a limited number of attempts.

The base code itself follows the concepts of **[Clean Architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2/)** proposed by [Uncle Bob](http://cleancoder.com/products) in [his book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164). Therefore, it conscerns to separate the core business logic (rules of the game) from any external factors like frameworks, libraries, environment, and UI. This separation consequently enhaces the maintainability, scalability and testability of the project in the long run.

The project is divided into three packages: core, **[CLI](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp)** and **[GUI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-graphical-user-interface/)**. So, this allows user to choose their preferred application for playing the game, whether by command-line interface or graphical interface.

## ⚙️ Archtecture

### 📦 Packages

- [Core](https://github.com/JohnPetros/clean-hangman/tree/main/packages/core) for protecting and encapsulating all the rules of the hangman game

- [CLI](https://github.com/JohnPetros/clean-hangman/tree/main/packages/cli) throughout the entire CLI application codebase.

- [GUI](https://github.com/JohnPetros/clean-hangman/tree/main/packages/gui) throughout the entire GUI application codebase.

### 🛠️ Technologies

This project was developed using the technologies bellow:

- ✔️ **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** for writing the code of all applications

- ✔️ **[Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)** for building the CLI application

- ✔️ **[Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html)** for writing [rich text](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/rich-text/#:~:text=Rich%20Text%20is%20a%20field,pure%20JSON%20rather%20than%20HTML.) to the terminal, and for displaying advanced content such as tables

- ✔️ **[Flet](https://flet.dev/)** for building multi-plataform GUI application powered by Flutter

## 🚀 How to run the application

### 🔧 Prerequisitives


- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for manipulating Git repositories
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) for installing the dependencies and running the application using [pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp), the official packange manager for Python.

> Also it is good to have a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you feel like writing the code base for any reason.

### 🏗️ Setup the project

```bash
